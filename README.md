# Databases

This project was developed as part of the course **Advanced Topics in Database Technology and Applications** during the **Spring semester of 2020–2021**. It centers around **data visualization**, allowing users to interact with and explore data through dynamic graphical representations.

## 🧩 Project Functionality

The application allows users to:

- Select **issues** from a predefined list  
- Choose **countries** to compare  
- Define a **time range** (years)

Based on the user's selections, the system retrieves the corresponding data from a database, processes it, and renders the appropriate visualization.
